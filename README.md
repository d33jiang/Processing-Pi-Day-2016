# Processing-Pi-Day-2016

This repository features two small hacks that I made on the morning of Pi Day 2016.

## Projects

### `Pi1`

[`Pi1`](/Pi1/Pi1.pde) features the derivation of pi using the ratio between the area of a circle and the smallest square that bounds the circle.

A real life experiment employing this strategy to derive pi would be to drop darts onto a horizontal dartboard while blindfolded.

### `Pi2`

[`Pi2`](/Pi2/Pi2.pde) features the derivation of pi using Buffon's needle drop experiment.

## Asymptotic Convergence

As more points are added at random and as more pins are dropped at random, the two experiments both converge on respective functions of pi.
